# Gradle Enterprise Frontend Code Project

Congratulations on advancing to the code project for a Frontend Engineer position on the Gradle Enterprise team!

This project aims to allow you to demonstrate your expertise and skills using industry-standard technologies such as `React` and `TypeScript` or `ES6` and additional tools you are already comfortable with.

## Installation instructions

You are already provided with a scaffold, including a script to start up the application. 

We have used [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) for the scaffold, so you can benefit from hot module reloading out of the box. We also enforce the usage of a specific `node` and `npm` version. See [package.json](./package.json) engines section.

From the root of this project, start the application and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/):

`npm install && npm run start`

## Implementation instructions

Follow the detailed instructions in the PDF that have been provided to you via email.

## Validation instructions

Ensure the application is assembled and the automated test suites executed when running the following command:

`npm install && npm run test`  <--- @Ami please check this command, I made it up :-)

## Evaluation criteria

The following criteria will play into the evaluation of your submission:

- Overall architecture and solution structure
- Code organization, readability and easiness to follow
- Data mapping and transformations
- Error & edge case handling
- Test coverage
- UI/UX design

## Reasoning

### Choices and considered alternatives
