# Develocity Frontend Code Project

Congratulations on advancing to the code project for a Frontend Engineer position on the Develocity team!

This project aims to allow you to demonstrate your expertise and skills using industry-standard technologies such as `React` and `TypeScript` and additional tools you are already comfortable with.

## Installation instructions

You'll start with a React and Vite project scaffold that's already set up with hot module reloading, ESLint rules, formatting, and a script to launch the application.

We also enforce the usage of a specific `node` and `npm` version. See the [package.json](./package.json) `engines` section.

From the root of this project, start the application and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/):

`npm install && npm run dev`

## Implementation instructions

Follow the detailed instructions in the PDF that has been provided to you via email.

## Validation instructions

Ensure the application is assembled and the automated test suites executed when running the following command:

`npm install && npm run test`
