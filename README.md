# Gradle Enterprise Frontend Code Project

Congratulations on advancing to the code project for a Frontend Engineer position on the Gradle Enterprise team!

This project aims to allow you to demonstrate your expertise using tools you are comfortable with, as well as industry-standard technologies such as `React`, `TypeScript` or `ES6`.
We assume you have a good understanding of the libraries and frameworks you choose to provide a solid and architecturally sound solution.

### Installation instructions

You are already provided with a scaffold and a script to start up the application. Simply run:
`npm install && npm run start`
then access the application at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

We have used [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) for the scaffold, so you can benefit from hot module reloading out of the box.
We also enforce the usage of a specific `node` and `npm` version. See [package.json](./package.json) engines section.

### Evaluation criteria

- Overall architecture and solution structure
- Code organization, readability and easiness to follow
- Data transformations
- Error & edge case handling
- Test coverage
- UI/UX design

Please include the reasoning about the choices made and considered alternatives in [Reasoning](#reasoning).
